[Introduction: This repository showcases my work on implementing a phishing alert detection system using the Let's Defend platform. Let's Defend is an open-source Security Operations Center (SOC) platform for incident response and threat detection. In this project, I focused on detecting phishing alerts by integrating threat intelligence, analyzing suspicious emails, and leveraging automated detection mechanisms within Let's Defend. The primary goal was to identify phishing attempts in real-time by evaluating various indicators, such as: Suspicious URLs and domains, Email header anomalies, Malicious attachments or links, and Behavioral analysis of phishing attempts.]
